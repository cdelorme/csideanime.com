# contribute

This project is new and no release is available yet.  **While contributions are welcome, we will not be accepting pull requests until after the first release.**

There is currently only one primary code-author, and contributions have been made with a request that they remain _anonymous_, as well as suggestions on our existing forum ([seaofnumbers.com](https://www.seaofnumbers.com)).

The source is available at [github.com/cdelorme/csideanime.com](https://github.com/cdelorme/csideanime.com), and the project is GPLv3 licensed.

The projects backend is `golang` which enforces its own style standards.  The javascript frontend has no coding style requirements at the moment.

Please file any **feature requests**, **enhancements**, **bug reports**, and **suggestions** through the [issue tracker](https://github.com/cdelorme/csideanime.com/issues).

After the alpha release we will happily accept:

- contributions to documentation
- translations

_We will be hesitant to accept code submissions until after beta._
