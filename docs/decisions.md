There are a lot of areas where we haven't made conclusion decisions yet.

- should our tagging system should allow for freehand text entry?
- should adding tags to auto-complete list could be tied a karma-point cost to prevent abuse?
- what actions should be tied to karma, and in what ways?
- how do we introduce a fair weight system into karma?
- do our users care about fancy statistic charts?
