# api

Our documentation covers two views of the API:

- [internal](internal/)
- [external](external/)

If you are a developer looking to use our API for your own services, then you want the [external docs](external/).

If you are a contributor to our project and want to understand how the code interfaces then you want to look at our [internal docs](internal/).
