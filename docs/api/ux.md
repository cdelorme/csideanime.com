At the moment we do not have a UX engineer. However, in the future it would be a good plan to find someone who can fill this role and help us improve the overall design of the site for our users.

Since we are building an API the good news is we can easily swap out one front­end for another.

With a well­built frontend employing the immediate­render technique, we can possibly also reuse all the client­side services that register data­callbacks and really only need to rebuild the rendering logic.
