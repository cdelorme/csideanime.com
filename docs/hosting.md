# hosting

Our plans are as follows:

- **Server:** [DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com)
- **Storage:** AWS S3 will be used to store static content and multimedia
- **CDN:** AWS CloudFront will be used to server static content efficiently

_The initial configuration will be a single server, but the architecture will be designed with scalable execution in mind for the future._
