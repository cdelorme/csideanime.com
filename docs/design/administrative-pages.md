# administrative pages

- forum settings
- ban management
- permission management

Keeping things simple is key.  We want to avoid a large layered menu.

Forum settings should be one page, and should only include features that can or should be accessible to administrators.  We may not even need it for the first release.

The ban management settings needs to be sane, but also flexible.  Do we want global-bans, or maybe by area, or controlled based on the limitations of the management role?  For now, a focus on global bans to provide bot management.  We should possibly discuss ways to avoid dealing with them.

Would it make sense to have a `developer` title with the same permissions as an administrator, to help differentiate between users who are not actually administrating the site but need access for testing purposes?  I believe this is a significant factor, I myself rarely act as an administrator, but I need the access rights to code and maintain the system.
