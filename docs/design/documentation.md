# documentation

I want to have comprehensive documentation for the project.  Ideally the documentation should be language-agnostic, which would allow me (or anyone else) to rebuild the entire application in any language for any platform.

**The primary objective here is to completely document each service before coding it.**


## [design](./)

The "**Design Document**", which details everything about the project.

It will describe everything about the project in a language-agnostic way, with enough detail that it can be used directly for development.


## [api](../api/)

This section will be for third parties to tether into the system.  It will also be used by anyone working on the frontend client-side code, as that will be connecting to the API using the same resources.


## [setup](../setup/)

These will be documents that describe how to install and configure a new copy of the site, including (to a small extent) deployment options.
