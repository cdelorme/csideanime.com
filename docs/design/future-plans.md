# future plans

The following items are not yet even in our documentation, but are planned as future features of the system:

- caching engine (likely elastic search)
- a search page & comprehensive search system
- private content & user uploads

A lack of a caching engine means our search results will likely not be speedy.

We will have tag based searches, but it will be limited in the first release.  This of course is dependent on a caching engine.

Our goal is to eventually bring private content into the mix, including user-uploaded multimedia.

_Our goal is not to become a streaming system, but we recongize that a number of our community members are artists who would like to share their work._
