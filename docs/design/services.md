**This is a tentative outline of services, not a comprehensive list, and is subject to change and grow.**

The following is a generic list of services, which will need to later be broken into frontend and backend development objectives:

- navigation (home, login, account, admin, members)
- admin section /w global settings, member management, ban management, and permission management pages
- permission system /w groups & actions
- open authentication
- member registration
- chat system
- tag management system (add/delete/apply-to-post-or-thread)
- threads by tag by popularity/activity
- thread management (create/edit/delete)
- post management (create/edit/delete)
- search mechanism, auto-complete by tag, otherwise fulltext search
- karma system
- site-theme system
- member profiles; settings, avatars, game ids, contact info, theme selection
- private conversations (member-to-one-or-more-members)
- statistics /w per-member and forum averages, fancy charts and graphs (maybe?)
    - page views, searches run, posts/threads made, top contributing members

_We still need to detail the behavior and logic behind each of these services, and update the list if we find mistakes._
