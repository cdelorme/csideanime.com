# search engine

Still uncertain as to the best approach for searches.

Ideally we should use a search index with full-text combining the contents of posts and threads with tags into one component.

However, placing higher weight on tags would be preferred, especially if the tag also exists in the message body of a post or title of the thread.

We may not need an advanced search, because we organize content by tags, technically the tag defines the path, and we end up with the same means of restricting search results.

Besides threads and posts, we may also want to index sections like blogs, anime/manga/game lists, reviews, and also members.

_It is unlikely that we will have a full search engine implemented in the alpha or evne beta release.  It is likely going to be implemented later._
