# theming

A theme system that allows either a standard format css file, or a well defined swappable css file would be nice.

I have considered using bootstrap theming, but may end up rolling something custom to keep things like.  In that case I will likely have to document the custom css, and integrate a way for members to share their custom-written themes with others.
