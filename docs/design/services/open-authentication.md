# open authentication

Referred here as `oauth`.  It is an alternative authentication mechanism that allows a member to use their login from another service to login to our service.  In this case we can trust google and facebook accounts as a means of identification.

_I am still working on understanding how to implement oauth, and it may end up being a direct sub-component of the member system._
