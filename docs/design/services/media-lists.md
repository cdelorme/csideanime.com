# media lists

I'd like to provide media lists for:

- anime
- manga
- games

Ideally if we can add to this list dynamically that'd be great, or use tags to identify the types instead.

_Ideally a means to handle ambiguity between things that are anime, and also manga, and also games would be ideal._

Features I want to provide for these include:

- a review system
- progress list
- release tracking

The review system should be obvious.  I want people to be able to add a game, anime, or manga, and provide a review on it.

I want to provide a flexible progress list.  For example, anime has episodes, I'd like members to be able to track the episodes of an anime they've watched.  Manga have volumes, same for manga.  Games may have any number of things, the ability to include custom notes per-user per-game would be sweet.  A private remote progress-tracking list.

Finally, release tracking is more complicated.  For games it'd probably be just listing a release date.  For manga and anime I'd like to have an entire system of fansubbing/scanlation groups, with links to their websites, lists of series they've worked on, and a release schedule.  This would allow members to update these systems, and help others easily keep track of available resources for anime and manga.

_I have only just begun to consider implementation details for this, and am certainly not close to a data schema yet, or even whether this should be broken down into smaller sections._
