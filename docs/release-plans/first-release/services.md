Our goal for a first release is to focus on the core of the application for a stable first-release that is well constructed to our needs.  We will be using a mobile-first perspective but expect to have a very limited and loose UI on the first-release.

- stupidly simple menu (home, login || account, admin, members)
- member registration /w google/facebook oauth integration
- chat system
- tags by popularity/activity
    - threads with tag
        - posts by thread
- basic management features, create/edit/delete threads/posts
- tagging mechanism /w type-ahead completion for threads/posts
- simplistic permissions system /w actions by group
- karma system /w points
- member profiles
    - settings /w avatars, game ids, contact info, theme selection
    - private/public conversations
    - stats (per-member & forum averages)
        - page views (per day/total)
        - searches run (per day/total)
        - posts (per day/total)
            - top contributing members
        - threads started (per day/total)
            - top contributing members
- admin pages
    - ban management
    - forum settings (for safe-to-modify global forum/community settings)
    - permission management (_security concerns regarding this, but probably a desired feature)

**This a tentative outline and is not yet complete.**
