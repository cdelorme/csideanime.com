I want to be clear that the first release is **not** the final product.

We expect it to be flawed, contain various bugs, have missing or even broken features, and not be the most pleasant experience.

Ideally, once we get our feet wet and have a project that compiles and executes we can begin fine-tuning where needed, and both fixing and adding requested or missing features.

*This release can be considered an alpha project.**

Our second release will be a _beta_ project, and we will hopefully have a lot more of the code refined by the time we reach our initial public launch.
